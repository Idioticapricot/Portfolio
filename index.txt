About me

I’m a Computer Science student who treats technology like a playground. 

Whether it’s teaching AI to read financial reports, minting creatures on the blockchain, or tracking motorcycles with full-stack apps, I love blending creativity with engineering. 

My goal: build tools that feel futuristic, but solve today’s problems.
